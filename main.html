    <!-- First paragraph about Time Complexity -->
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete 
        as a function of the length of the input. A lower time complexity often indicates a more 
        <b>efficient</b> algorithm.
    </p>

    <!-- Second paragraph about Space Complexity -->
    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during its execution. 
        For example, an algorithm with space usage proportional to its input size can be expressed as O(n).
